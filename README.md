This is a repo containing the coding projects from all the open online courses I have completed or am working through!

Here is a list of the courses and their status, and which directory the projects are located in:
- Directory `python`: [Introduction to Computer Science and Programming using Python](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-mitx-6-00-1x-10), completed.
- Directory `simple-data`: [How to Code - Simple Data](https://www.edx.org/course/how-code-simple-data-ubcx-htc1x), completed.
- Directory `complex-data`: [How to Code - Complex Data](https://www.edx.org/course/how-code-complex-data-ubcx-htc2x), completed.
- Directory `machine-learning`: [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning), completed.
- Directory `algorithms`: two courses
  1. [Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part I](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/course-v1:Engineering+Algorithms1+SelfPaced/about) and [Part II](https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/course-v1:Engineering+Algorithms2+SelfPaced/about), __in progress__.
  2. [Algorithms, Part I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1) and [Part II](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2), upcoming.
- Directory `object-oriented-design`: [Object-Oriented Design Concepts](http://web.cs.wpi.edu/~cs2102/b16/index.html), __in progress__.


I have also completed the C part of [CS50](cs50.io) and CPSC 223: Data Structures and Algorithms at Yale University.
